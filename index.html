      <h2 class="section-title" data-scroll>Cosmic Wonders</h2>
      <p data-scroll>As you venture deeper into the cosmos, you'll witness the dance of celestial bodies that have existed for billions of years. Each star tells a story of cosmic evolution, of matter transformed through the crucible of gravity and nuclear fusion.</p>
      
      <p data-scroll>The nebulae you see are stellar nurseries—cosmic clouds where new stars are born from the remnants of their ancestors. These vast, colorful formations stretch across light-years of space, shaping the universe with their elemental alchemy.</p>
      
      <h2 class="section-title" data-scroll>Interstellar Travel</h2>
      <p data-scroll>Our journey takes us through the vast emptiness between stars, where light itself takes years to cross. Yet in this seeming void, fascinating phenomena await discovery—dark matter binding galaxies together, cosmic radiation from distant quasars, and perhaps even wormholes connecting distant points in space-time.</p>
      
      <p data-scroll>As we travel, notice how perspective shifts. Stars that appeared clustered together reveal themselves to be separated by immense distances. This is cosmic parallax in action—the changing of apparent positions based on your own movement through space.</p>
      
      <h2 class="section-title" data-scroll>Beyond The Observable</h2>
      <p data-scroll>The universe we observe is but a fraction of what exists. Beyond our visual horizon lies an expanse so vast that light from its farthest reaches has not yet had time to reach us since the dawn of the universe. What wonders might exist in those distant realms?</p>
      
      <p data-scroll>Some theorize multiple universes existing alongside our own, like bubbles in a cosmic foam. Others suggest dimensions beyond the familiar three of space and one of time. As you journey onward, consider that the true nature of reality may be stranger and more beautiful than we can comprehend.</p>
      
      <h2 class="section-title" data-scroll>Return Journey</h2>
      <p data-scroll>As we begin our return to Earth, take a moment to reflect on our cosmic insignificance and profound importance. In all the vastness of space and time, we exist in this brief moment, conscious beings capable of contemplating the universe that gave rise to us.</p>
      
      <p data-scroll>Our atoms were forged in stellar furnaces billions of years ago. We are, as Carl Sagan famously said, "star stuff contemplating the stars." This cosmic journey is, in a very real sense, the universe exploring itself.</p>
